
Utilities are pre-assembled code for executing various common tasks
within pipeline jobs. One of the most important is the conversion of
array task IDs into the specific work to be executed by a worker.

shell script utilities
-------------------------------------------------------------------

q automatically provides a series of functions to shell worker scripts,
e.g. bash script 'myScript.sh' - you do not need to initialize these 
functions in your script. See the q documentation for details.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
non-shell script utilities
-------------------------------------------------------------------

In some cases, q also provides utilities to worker scripts written in a
non-shell languange. In these cases, you need to add one line to your 
worker script to initialize the utility functions.  Currently, utilities
are available for worker scripts in the following languages:

R         utilities.R
Perl      utilities.pl

See each utility script for details on its functions and how to initialize
them in your worker script.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
miscellaneous utilities
-------------------------------------------------------------------

The q distribution includes other utilities packages that you may find 
useful. Many of these are designed to work as stream utilities. All 
program targets of these utility packages are automatically available
in the environment PATH, so they can simply be called from within a 
shell worker script, e.g.

slurp myFile | ...

vital statistics
--------------------

'set_stat' and 'get_stat' are two related utilities that provide a method for
storing and retrieving statistics about a target entity using a disk CSV file. 
 
--------------------
file slurping
--------------------

'slurp' and 'glurp' are related utilites that help with buffering of file input
and output (IO) in parallel environments with large files.

--------------------
BED utilities
--------------------

'bedutil' is a set of utilities for manipulation of BED files. The focus of
these tools is on permutation simulations of features.
