'bedutil' is a set of utilities for manipulation of BED files.
The focus of these tools is on permutation simulation and regression
analysis of features.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Perl - http://www.perl.org/

R - http://www.r-project.org/

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

bedutil is called from the command line as:

    bedutil <command> <value_option>=<value> <boolean_option>  [...]

where commands are enumerated below, and the required and optional
parameters can be listed using:

    bedutil <command> --help

Parameters can also be passed implicitly as environment variables, making
bedutil friendly to calling from within q pipelines.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
CREATE A SIMULATION TABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------
permute
----------------

'permute' takes feature BED lines and prints the BED itself as well as
random permutations of the BED.  The iteration number is appended as the
last field (==-1 for the input BED features).

----------------
crossing
----------------

'crossing' takes feature BED lines and calculates a score against a
provided reference BED file based on whether the input feature crosses
one or more reference features.  Various score types are possible.

----------------
crosstab
----------------

'crosstab' takes feature BED lines that have had an evaluation score added
as the last column, and a simulation iteration added as the penultimate column.
A scores table of input features (rows) by iterations (columns) is created,
using the BED name field as the unique feature identifier.

----------------
simulate
----------------

'simulate' takes feature BED lines and streams them through
'permute | crossing | crosstab' as a shortcut for assembling a complete
simulation table.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYZE A SIMULATION TABLE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------
cdf
----------------

'cdf' takes an assembled simulation as formatted by crosstab and assembles
plots of the estimated cumulative distribution function (CDF) as well as
rank-quantile plots of the iterations of the smallest, median, and largest
input features.

----------------
normtest
----------------

'normtest' takes an assembled simulation as formatted by crosstab and applies
the Shapiro-Wilk normality test to the iteration values of each feature. A plot
is constructed showing the normality test p-value as a function of feature length.

----------------
aggregate
----------------

'aggregate' takes an assembled simulation as formatted by crosstab and
estimates enrichment p-values by two methods. 1) The distribution of aggregated
feature scores for each iteration is plotted and compared to the actual
aggregate feature score. 2) The distribution of the quantiles of the actual
scores for each feature relative to its iterations is plotted and subjected to
one-sample two-sided Sign and Wilcoxon tests.

----------------
by_score
----------------

'by_score' takes an assembled simulation as formatted by crosstab and stratifies
the input features by the original BED score field (field 5). A correlation plot
of these strata to the appended score (field 7) for the actual input features
(iteration = -1) is constructed and Pearson and Spearman coefficients calculated.
The 'aggregate' command is then applied to each stratum and box plots made to
assess the correlation of simulation score enrichment with the original score.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MANIPULATE BED FEATURES AND ASSESS CLUSTERING
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------
split
----------------

'split' takes feature BED lines and splits any overlapping features
into new smaller features corresponding to each unique overlap segment.

----------------
group
----------------

'group' takes feature BED lines on STDIN and groups them by coordinate.

----------------
collapse
----------------

'collapse' takes feature BED lines and collapses them into contiguous
BED features that fuse previously overlapping features into one feature.

----------------
hotspot
----------------

'hotspot' takes feature BED lines and collapses them.  The input features are
further subjected to permutation, with the permuted features collapsed within
each iteration to determine the likelihood that actual overlap clusters were
observed by chance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ANALYZE BED SCORES (WITHOUT SIMULATION)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------
correlate
----------------

'correlate' takes two merged BED streams and calculates correlation coefficients
between their score fields (field 5).

----------------
regression
----------------

'regression' takes feature BED lines, streams them through 'crossing'
to collect a second score value, and then performs regression analysis
comparing the input scores (field 5) to the newly calculated scores.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEPRECATED
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

----------------
frequency DEPRECATED
----------------

'frequency' takes feature BED lines that have had an evaluation score
added as the last column, and a simulation iteration added as the
penultimate column.  For each iteration, an aggregate feature score is
calculated.  A frequency distribution of the aggregrate values is constructed.

----------------
distribution DEPRECATED
----------------

'distribution' takes feature BED lines that have had an evaluation score
added as the last column, and a simulation iteration added as the
penultimate column. Frequency distributions of the actual individual scores,
and separately all individual iteration scores, are constructed.

----------------
relate DEPRECATED
----------------

'relate' takes feature BED lines that have had a dependent evaluation score
added as the last column, a simulation iteration added as the penultimate
column, and that bear an independent feature score in BED column 5. A plot
is constructed correlating the dependent score to the independent score for
the actual data points, with ranges for the simulation. A correlation
coefficient is calculated for the actual data.
