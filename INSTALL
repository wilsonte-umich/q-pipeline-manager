From the directory containing this INSTALL file:

    $ perl configure.pl

    reading system information ............................
    generating q program target
    done
    created q program target:
      /path/to/some/folder/q-<#.#.#>/q

Perform a quick check for appropriate installation by calling q with no commands or options:
 
    $ ./q

    q version #.#.#
    q is a utility for submitting, monitoring and managing data analysis pipelines
    usage:  q <command> [options] <masterFile> [...]
    masterFile = path to a master instructions file
    use 'q --help' or 'q <command> --help' for extended help
 
In most cases you will want to add ‘/path/to/some/folder/q-<#.#.#>’ to your server 
system PATH variable so that it is available to you from any server directory by 
simply typing ‘q’.  Details of how to do this will depend on your server and account 
configuration.

Familiarize yourself with q as follows:

    $ q --help
    $ q submit --help
    $ q submit --dry-run q_example.q
